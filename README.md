Movie Rating Data Analysis by Wendy Molina

Data set obtained from Kaggle website:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/movie-rating-dataset

This data set captures the popularity of a movie along with its characters, release date, revenue and more.

My objective in this data analysis is to see if there is a significant correlation between movie budget and popularity rating.
